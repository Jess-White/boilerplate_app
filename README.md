I was inspired to build Boilerplate by my work as a grantwriter. The nonprofits I wrote grants for were small organizations without resources to devote to fundraising. Smaller nonprofits are especially reliant on grant funding, but many cannot afford to hire a professional grantwriter or reserve significant staff time for regular grant applications. 

Without dedicated resources, grant writing is often an ad hoc process. Grants are drafted using information from many scattered sources, including prior grants, data stored in multiple departments, and any number of additional maters. This results in an inefficient process with fewer grant applications overall.

Collecting this information in one place would make it much easier to use, so I decided to build a tool that would allow any member of staff to quickly access all of the organization and program info they needed to quickly draft a grant application. 

I also wanted to create an intuitive grantwriting toolbox. Although requests for proposals vary widely, grant applications and best practices share many similarities. Boilerplate provides access not only to grant materials, but also to simple and accessible grant templates. 

Boilerplate allows users to create and save "boilerplates," editable text sections on all aspects of the organization. Users can also quickly generate grant applications using a simple template, and then add boilerplates into the draft. The grant can be finalized as a pdf document or saved as editable text that can be submitted through an online grant application form. In addition, users can access and edit organization profiles, and staff bios.
